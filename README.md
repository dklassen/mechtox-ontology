#Mechanistic Toxicology(MechTox) Ontology

The purpose of the mechanistic toxicology ontology is to build a framework for
capturing knowledge of toxicity. Predictive toxicology and risk assessment
depend on accurate models developed from structured information. However, most
knowledge is represented as text, and as such has limited value for
automatically building models with explanatory power. Formal knowledge
representation provides a logical framework to capture knowledge as structured
information. All aspects from chemical structure to biological activity,
toxicity mechanisms, and risk assessment can be captured and leveraged for
interpretation.  The Semantic Web is a set of standards to formally represent
knowledge and publish, share, link, query, and reuse knowledge using core
Internet technologies. Representation of knowledge is accomplished through
formal languages. The Web Ontology Language, OWL, is a knowledge representation
language based on description logics. Knowledge encoded using OWL is amenable
to automated reasoning allowing new knowledge to be discovered through
inferencing of integrated knowledge. A knowledge base developed using OWL
offers knowledge consistency checking, subsumption inferences, data
classification, and question answering.
